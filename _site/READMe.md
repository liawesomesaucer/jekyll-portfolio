# Portfolio Site
This is my portfolio site, showing some of the work I've done. Here's a [link](http://vincentliaw.me). Originally, this site was built in MeteorJS (as you can see in [this](https://github.com/liawesomesaucer/portfolio) repo), but Meteor ended their free hosting in May and I was left to copy rendered templates and use this as a static site. 

Will consider moving to Jekyll soon, as I've used it to build [this site](http://designucsd.org) and it's been a straitforward (albeit sometimes shaky) experience.
