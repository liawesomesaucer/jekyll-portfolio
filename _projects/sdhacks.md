SD Hacks 2016 is bringing 1,000 technologically-savvy hackers to UC San Diego to build revolutionary projects. Since the inception of our beach theme site in early March, I've worked with and on the tech team to design and build the final SD Hacks site [sdhacks.io](http://sdhacks.io).

On the tech team, I've worked on a couple potential designs for the final site and on implemention (mostly frontend). We built the final site in MEAN stack, hosted on Heroku.

We've inspired hackers, old and new, to build cool things at SD Hacks 2016, and look forward to continue cultivating a learning experience in hackathons beyond.
