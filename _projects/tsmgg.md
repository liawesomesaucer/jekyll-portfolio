Worked with one other developer on building the frontend of Team SoloMid's news site. Handled most of the styling, featuring mobile-friendly responsive design from the ground up without any frontend frameworks. Building this site involved using ES6+ Javascript, React, Redux, and NodeJS. Site was built following the Airbnb CSS and ES6 Javascript style guides.

Other work with Team Solomid involved building an asynchronously loaded tooltips API featured across Probuilds and Champion.GG and a rebuilt content admin system.
