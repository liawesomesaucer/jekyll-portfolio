For this site, I worked on design and development with a small group of UCSD students. Knowing that Design at UCSD needed a website to increase reputation, outreach and marketing efforts, we designed and built our site over the summer.

This site was built with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap on Jekyll by me and one other developer. We picked Jekyll for how lightweight it was and we wished to utilize free hosting as much as possible. This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and is periodically updated when adding new events and content. See our [Github repository](https://github.com/designucsd/designucsd.github.io) to learn more.
