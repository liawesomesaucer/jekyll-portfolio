SD Hacks is scheduled for this October 20-22nd and still in the planning stage, so I'll update with a more in-depth writeup after things wrap up.

My role: Designer + Frontend Developer

A couple months after a successful SD Hacks 2016, I and some of the SD Hacks team took some steps back and evaluated where our web presence stood as a whole. Our previous site was a combination of many attempted themes, with a difficult (and corporate looking) color scheme. (I'll bash it all I want, because I designed it.) The team decided to start a rebrand from scratch, deciding only to keep the logo.

We started at the drawing board and asked ourselves what we'd like each and every attendee to feel when attending SD Hacks. After much parallel prototyping and discussion, we arrived at three primary core values:

*At SD Hacks, we're about:*

> *Empowerment* - We provide all hackers with expertise, hardware and software so they can build their dreams.

> *Collaboration* - Weâ€™re all here as fellow mentors, 4am-ers, and friends.

> *Innovation* - We strive to make each SD Hacks a memorable learning experience for all.

With our core values in mind I began drafting some rough UI mocks and brainstorming the color scheme. Inspired by various flat UI and maritime color schemes, along with the sunny, beachy aesthetic of UC San Diego, I chose light, ocean-friendly colors, with the blue based on our current logo.

With the colors set, I began drafting high fidelity mockups, experimenting with isometric shapes and stripes that played well with our hexagon logo, and featurettes for each of the core values. I also created a [styleguide](https://invis.io/HZCT92XR5#/246860480_Styleguide) to speed development.

After rounds of feedback and gathering finalized content, I set out to create this splash page in Pug, SASS and some JS for animations.

Thanks to the design team members Ming Ming Liu, Nick Thomson, and Rishi Dhanaraj for help in the brainstorming process and feedback on UI designs. Big shoutout to Nick Thomson who introduced me to isometricism and implemented the SD Hacks backend and some of the front.
