We built this website for The Art of Espresso, a coffee cart on the UCSD campus sitting cozily between Muir College and Library Walk. We emphasized the aesthetic of AOE by emulating the cozy, "sticky spot" feeling in our site, using a combination of earthly and coffee tones. Additionally, after analysis of our user base, we began development mobile first. Consistency was emphasized between mobile and desktop. This website was built for COGS187B, Practicum in Professional Field Design.
